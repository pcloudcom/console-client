# About

This is a fork of pcloudcom/console-client commit [618da8aa7d3130cc358b143714d375473418729d](https://github.com/pcloudcom/console-client/commit/618da8aa7d3130cc358b143714d375473418729d).

This verson will allow non-root user access to the pcloud mount and is several commits ahead of the pcloudcom master (at time of writing).

Many error messages (or deprecated notices) during "Make" have been squashed.

## pCloud Console Client

This is a simple linux console client for pCloud cloud storage. 

## Required libraries 
[Zlib](http://zlib.net/)  A Massively Spiffy Yet Delicately Unobtrusive Compression Library.  
[Boost](http://www.boost.org/) Boost system and boost program options libraries used.  
[Pthread](http://www.gnu.org/)   
[Fuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) Filesystem in Userspace.  
  
Also requires   
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system.  

On Ubuntu you can run the following command:  
> sudo apt-get install cmake zlib1g-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-program-options-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libfuse-dev  

## Build steps

>sudo apt-get install cmake zlib1g-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-program-options-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libfuse-dev git
>mkdir console-client
>git clone https://github.com/ChaosZero112/console-client.git ./console-client/
>cd ./console-client/pCloudCC/
>cd lib/pclsync/
>make clean
>make fs
>cd ../mbedtls/
>cmake .
>make clean
>make
>cd ../..
>cmake .
>make
>sudo make install
>ldconfig
>pcloudcc -u username -p

## Usage
Terminal command is pcloudcc and -h option prints short options description.
> ./pcloudcc -h  
>  pCloud console client v.2.0.1  
>Allowed options:  
>  -h [ --help ]             produce help message  
>  -u [ --username ] arg     pCloud account name  
>  -p [ --password ]         pCloud account password  
>  -c [ --crypto ] arg       Crypto password  
>  -y [ --passascrypto ] arg Use user password as crypto password also.  
>  -d [ --daemonize ]        Daemonize the process.  
>  -o [ --commands  ]        Parent stays alive and processes commands.   
>  -m [ --mountpoint ] arg   Mount point where drive to be mounted.  
>  -k [ --commands_only ]    Daemon already started pass only commands.  
>  -n [ --newuser ]          Switch if this is a new user to be registered.  
>  -s [ --savepassword ]     Save password in database.  


Also there are several commands that the running service can execute. Commands are passed using 
> pcloudcc -k 

or  starting the daemon with -o. 

Available commands are : startcrypto <crypto pass>, stopcrypto, finalize, q, quit  
- startcrypto <crypto pass> - starts cripto using given password.
-  stopcrypto – stops the crypto.
-   finalize – stops the running daemon.
- quit, q  - exits the current client. Daemon stays alive.


Example usage scenario:  
- Start the service manually

> pcloudcc -u example@myemail.com -p -s   

Enter password and  use -s switch to save the password. 

- Verify that file system starts and mounts normally. If you don't have existing user use -n switch to register new user:  

> pcloudcc -u example@myemail.com -p -s -n

Notice that a new user may take a while to mount. Please, be patient.   

- Start the daemon service:

> pcloudcc -u example@myemail.com -d  

- Verify file system is mounted.  

- At that point you can test passing some commands.

> pcloudcc -u example@myemail.com -k  

Or starting the daemon with -o. Test unlocking and locking crypto if you have subscription for it.   

- Quit the client. Congratulations, your pcloud console client works properly.  You can now add “pcloudcc -u example@myemail.com -d” command in you startup scripts  and thous mount the file system on startup.
