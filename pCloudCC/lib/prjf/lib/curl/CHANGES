  cmake: Fix finding Brotli on case-sensitive file systems
  
  - Find package "Brotli" instead of "BROTLI" since the former is the

  libcurl: Add testcase for gopher redirects
  
  The testcase ensures that redirects to CURLPROTO_GOPHER won't be
  allowed, by default, in the future. Also, curl is being used
  for convenience while keeping the testcases DRY.
  
  The expected error code is CURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL when the client is

  libcurl: Restrict redirect schemes
  
  All protocols except for CURLPROTO_FILE/CURLPROTO_SMB and their TLS
  counterpart were allowed for redirect. This vastly broadens the
  exploitation surface in case of a vulnerability such as SSRF [1], where
  libcurl-based clients are forced to make requests to arbitrary hosts.
  
  For instance, CURLPROTO_GOPHER can be used to smuggle any TCP-based
  protocol by URL-encoding a payload in the URI. Gopher will open a TCP
  connection and send the payload.
  
  Only HTTP/HTTPS and FTP are allowed. All other protocols have to be
  explicitly enabled for redirects through CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS.

- headers: Remove no longer exported functions
  
  There were a leftover few prototypes of Curl_ functions that we used to
  export but no longer do, this removes those prototypes and cleans up any
  comments still referring to them.
  
  Curl_write32_le(), Curl_strcpy_url(), Curl_strlen_url(), Curl_up_free()
  Curl_concat_url(), Curl_detach_connnection(), Curl_http_setup_conn()
  were made static in 05b100aee247bb9bec8e9a1b0166496aa4248d1c.
  Curl_http_perhapsrewind() made static in 574aecee208f79d391f10d57520b3.
  
  For the remainder, I didn't trawl the Git logs hard enough to capture
  their exact time of deletion, but they were all gone: Curl_splayprint(),
  Curl_http2_send_request(), Curl_global_host_cache_dtor(),
  Curl_scan_cache_used(), Curl_hostcache_destroy(), Curl_second_connect(),
  Curl_http_auth_stage() and Curl_close_connections().

  nss: support using libnss on macOS
  
  The file suffix for dynamically loadable objects on macOS is .dylib,

  NSS TLS backend to work properly on macOS.

  nss: don't set unused parameter
  
  The value of the maxPTDs parameter to PR_Init() has since at least
  NSPR 2.1, which was released sometime in 1998, been marked ignored
  as is accordingly not used in the initialization code.  Setting it
  to a value when calling PR_Init() is thus benign, but indicates an

- tool_cb_prg: Fix integer overflow in progress bar
  
  Commit 61faa0b420c236480bc9ef6fd52b4ecc1e0f8d17 fixed the progress bar
  width calculation to avoid integer overflow, but failed to account for
  the fact that initial_size is initialized to -1 when the file size is
  retrieved from the remote on an upload, causing another signed integer
  overflow.  Fix by separately checking for this case before the width
  calculation.

- multi: make sure 'data' can present in several sockhash entries
  
  Since more than one socket can be used by each transfer at a given time,
  each sockhash entry how has its own hash table with transfers using that
  socket.
  
  In addition, the sockhash entry can now be marked 'blocked = TRUE'"
  which then makes the delete function just set 'removed = TRUE' instead
  of removing it "for real", as a way to not rip out the carpet under the
  feet of a parent function that iterates over the transfers of that same
  sockhash entry.

  http2: Stop drain from being permanently set on
  
  Various functions called within Curl_http2_done() can have the
  side-effect of setting the Easy connection into drain mode (by calling
  drain_this()).  However, the last time we unset this for a transfer (by
  calling drained_transfer()) is at the beginning of Curl_http2_done().
  If the Curl_easy is reused for another transfer, it is then stuck in
  drain mode permanently, which in practice makes it unable to write any
  data in the new transfer.
  
  This fix moves the last call to drained_transfer() to later in
  Curl_http2_done(), after the functions that could potentially call for a
  drain.

- Revert "multi: support verbose conncache closure handle"
  
  This reverts commit b0972bc.
  
  - No longer show verbose output for the conncache closure handle.
  
  The offending commit was added so that the conncache closure handle
  would inherit verbose mode from the user's easy handle. (Note there is
  no way for the user to set options for the closure handle which is why
  that was necessary.) Other debug settings such as the debug function
  were not also inherited since we determined that could lead to crashes
  if the user's per-handle private data was used on an unexpected handle.
  
  The reporter here says he has a debug function to capture the verbose
  output, and does not expect or want any output to stderr; however
  because the conncache closure handle does not inherit the debug function
  the verbose output for that handle does go to stderr.
  
  There are other plausible scenarios as well such as the user redirects
  stderr on their handle, which is also not inherited since it could lead
  to crashes when used on an unexpected handle.
  
  Short of allowing the user to set options for the conncache closure
  handle I don't think there's much we can safely do except no longer
  inherit the verbose setting.

  OpenSSL: Report -fips in version if OpenSSL is built with FIPS
  
  Older versions of OpenSSL report FIPS availabilty via an OPENSSL_FIPS
  define. It uses this define to determine whether to publish -fips at
  the end of the version displayed. Applications that utilize the version
  reported by OpenSSL will see a mismatch if they compare it to what curl
  reports, as curl is not modifying the version in the same way. This
  change simply adds a check to see if OPENSSL_FIPS is defined, and will
  alter the reported version to match what OpenSSL itself provides. This
  only appears to be applicable in versions of OpenSSL <1.1.1

  With transfers being queued up, we only move one at a a time back to the
  CONNECT state but now we mark moved transfers so that when a moved

  move of another pending transfer. Previously, it would otherwise wait

- cmake: clear CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES after each use
  
  This fixes GSSAPI builds with the libraries in a non-standard location.
  The testing for recv() were failing because it failed to link
  the Kerberos libraries, which are not needed for this or subsequent
  tests.
  
  fixes #3743
  closes #3744

- cmake: avoid linking executable for some tests with cmake 3.6+
  
  With CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE set to STATIC_LIBRARY, the try_compile()
  (which is used by check_c_source_compiles()) will build static library
  instead of executable. This avoids linking additional libraries in and thus
  speeds up those checks a little.
  
  This commit also avoids #3743 (GSSAPI build errors) on itself with cmake
  3.6 or above. That issue was fixed separately for all versions.

  examples/externalsocket: add missing close socket calls
  
  .. and for Windows also call WSACleanup since we call WSAStartup.
  
  The example is to demonstrate handling the socket independently of
  libcurl. In this case libcurl is not responsible for creating, opening
  or closing the socket, it is handled by the application (our example).

- multi: removed unused code for request retries
  
  This code was once used for the non multi-interface using code path, but
  ever since easy_perform was turned into a wrapper around the multi
  interface, this code path never runs.

- doh: inherit some SSL options from user's easy handle
  
  - Inherit SSL options for the doh handle but not SSL client certs,
    SSL ALPN/NPN, SSL engine, SSL version, SSL issuer cert,
    SSL pinned public key, SSL ciphers, SSL id cache setting,
    SSL kerberos or SSL gss-api settings.
  
  - Fix inheritance of verbose setting.
  
  - Inherit NOSIGNAL.
  
  There is no way for the user to set options for the doh (DNS-over-HTTPS)
  handles and instead we inherit some options from the user's easy handle.
  
  My thinking for the SSL options not inherited is they are most likely
  not intended by the user for the DOH transfer. I did inherit insecure
  because I think that should still be in control of the user.
  
  Prior to this change doh did not work for me because CAINFO was not
  inherited. Also verbose was set always which AFAICT was a bug (#3660).

- [Arnaud Rebillout brought this change]

  examples: various fixes in ephiperfifo.c

  1000). This resulted in the callback being invoked WAY TOO OFTEN.

  If the cookieinfo pointer is NULL there really is nothing to save.
  
  Without this fix, we got a problem when a handle was using shared object
  with cookies and is told to "FLUSH" it to file (which worked) and then
  the share object was removed and when the easy handle was closed just
  afterwards it has no cookieinfo and no cookies so it decided to save an
  empty jar (overwriting the file just flushed).

- easy: fix win32 init to work without CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32
  
  - Change the behavior of win32_init so that the required initialization
    procedures are not affected by CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32 flag.
  
  libcurl via curl_global_init supports initializing for win32 with an
  optional flag CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32, which if omitted was meant to stop
  Winsock initialization. It did so internally by skipping win32_init()
  when that flag was set. Since then win32_init() has been expanded to
  include required initialization routines that are separate from
  Winsock and therefore must be called in all cases. This commit fixes
  it so that CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32 only controls the optional win32
  initialization (which is Winsock initialization, according to our doc).
  
  The only users affected by this change are those that don't pass
  CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32 to curl_global_init. For them this commit removes the
  risk of a potential crash.

  connection_check: restore original conn->data after the check
  
  - Save the original conn->data before it's changed to the specified
    data transfer for the connection check and then restore it afterwards.
  
  This is a follow-up to 38d8e1b 2019-02-11.
  
  History:
  
  It was discovered a month ago that before checking whether to extract a
  dead connection that that connection should be associated with a "live"
  transfer for the check (ie original conn->data ignored and set to the
  passed in data). A fix was landed in 54b201b which did that and also
  cleared conn->data after the check. The original conn->data was not
  restored, so presumably it was thought that a valid conn->data was no
  longer needed.
  
  Several days later it was discovered that a valid conn->data was needed
  after the check and follow-up fix was landed in bbae24c which partially
  reverted the original fix and attempted to limit the scope of when
  conn->data was changed to only when pruning dead connections. In that
  case conn->data was not cleared and the original conn->data not
  restored.
  
  A month later it was discovered that the original fix was somewhat
  correct; a "live" transfer is needed for the check in all cases
  because original conn->data could be null which could cause a bad deref
  at arbitrary points in the check. A fix was landed in 38d8e1b which
  expanded the scope to all cases. conn->data was not cleared and the
  original conn->data not restored.
  
  A day later it was discovered that not restoring the original conn->data
  may lead to busy loops in applications that use the event interface, and
  given this observation it's a pretty safe assumption that there is some
  code path that still needs the original conn->data. This commit is the
  follow-up fix for that, it restores the original conn->data after the
  connection check.

- transfer.c: do not compute length of undefined hex buffer.
  
  On non-ascii platforms, the chunked hex header was measured for char code
  conversion length, even for chunked trailers that do not have an hex header.
  In addition, the efective length is already known: use it.
  Since the hex length can be zero, only convert if needed.

- zsh.pl: escape ':' character
  
  ':' is interpreted as separator by zsh, so if used as part of the argument
  or option's description it needs to be escaped.
  
  The problem can be reproduced as follows:
  
   % curl --reso<TAB>
   % curl -E <TAB>
  
  Bug: https://bugs.debian.org/921452

- zsh.pl: update regex to better match curl -h output
  
  The current regex fails to match '<...>' arguments properly (e.g. those
  with spaces in them), which causes an completion script with wrong

  version to the one with this fix:

  Fixes #3436

   Problem 1
  
  After LOTS of scratching my head, I eventually realized that even when doing
  10 uploads in parallel, sometimes the socket callback to the application that
  tells it what to wait for on the socket, looked like it would reflect the
  status of just the single transfer that just changed state.
  
  Digging into the code revealed that this was indeed the truth. When multiple
  transfers are using the same connection, the application did not correctly get
  the *combined* flags for all transfers which then could make it switch to READ
  (only) when in fact most transfers wanted to get told when the socket was
  WRITEABLE.
  
   Problem 1b
  
  A separate but related regression had also been introduced by me when I
  cleared connection/transfer association better a while ago, as now the logic
  couldn't find the connection and see if that was marked as used by more
  transfers and then it would also prematurely remove the socket from the socket
  hash table even in times other transfers were still using it!
  
   Fix 1
  
  Make sure that each socket stored in the socket hash has a "combined" action
  field of what to ask the application to wait for, that is potentially the ORed
  action of multiple parallel transfers. And remove that socket hash entry only
  if there are no transfers left using it.
  
   Problem 2
  
  The socket hash entry stored an association to a single transfer using that
  socket - and when curl_multi_socket_action() was called to tell libcurl about
  activities on that specific socket only that transfer was "handled".
  
  This was WRONG, as a single socket/connection can be used by numerous parallel
  transfers and not necessarily a single one.
  
   Fix 2
  
  We now store a list of handles in the socket hashtable entry and when libcurl
  is told there's traffic for a particular socket, it now iterates over all
  known transfers using that single socket.

    curl --resolve *:443:10.0.0.2 --resolve a.com:443:10.0.0.1 \
         https://a.com https://b.com

  This is a companion patch to cbea2fd2c (NTLM: force the connection to

  preemptively. However, with other (Negotiate) authentication it is not
  clear to this developer whether there is a way to make it work with
  HTTP/2, so let's try HTTP/2 first and fall back in case we encounter the
  error HTTP_1_1_REQUIRED.
  
  Note: we will still keep the NTLM workaround, as it avoids an extra

  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-10/http2-on-iis#when-is-http2-not-supported).
  
  When we just found out that we want to use NTLM, and when the current

- travis: enable COPYRIGHTYEAR extended warning
  
  The extended warning for checking incorrect COPYRIGHTYEAR is quite
  expensive to run, so rather than expecting every developer to do it
  we ensure it's turned on locally for Travis.

- checksrc: add COPYRIGHTYEAR check
  
  Forgetting to bump the year in the copyright clause when hacking has
  been quite common among curl developers, but a traditional checksrc
  check isn't a good fit as it would penalize anyone hacking on January
  1st (among other things). This adds a more selective COPYRIGHTYEAR
  check which intends to only cover the currently hacked on changeset.
  
  The check for updated copyright year is currently not enforced on all
  files but only on files edited and/or committed locally. This is due to
  the amount of files which aren't updated with their correct copyright
  year at the time of their respective commit.
  
  To further avoid running this expensive check for every developer, it
  adds a new local override mode for checksrc where a .checksrc file can
  be used to turn on extended warnings locally.

- openssl: support session resume with TLS 1.3
  
  Session resumption information is not available immediately after a TLS 1.3
  handshake. The client must wait until the server has sent a session ticket.
  
  Use OpenSSL's "new session" callback to get the session information and put it
  into curl's session cache. For TLS 1.3 sessions, this callback will be invoked
  after the server has sent a session ticket.
  
  The "new session" callback is invoked only if OpenSSL's session cache is
  enabled, so enable it and use the "external storage" mode which lets curl manage
  the contents of the session cache.
  
  A pointer to the connection data and the sockindex are now saved as "SSL extra
  data" to make them available to the callback.
  
  This approach also works for old SSL/TLS versions and old OpenSSL versions.

  ares: remove fd from multi fd set when ares is about to close the fd
  
  When using c-ares for asyn dns, the dns socket fd was silently closed
  by c-ares without curl being aware. curl would then 'realize' the fd
  has been removed at next call of Curl_resolver_getsock, and only then
  notify the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION to remove fd from its poll set with
  CURL_POLL_REMOVE. At this point the fd is already closed.
  
  By using ares socket state callback (ARES_OPT_SOCK_STATE_CB), this
  patch allows curl to be notified that the fd is not longer needed
  for neither for write nor read. At this point by calling
  Curl_multi_closed we are able to notify multi with CURL_POLL_REMOVE
  before the fd is actually closed by ares.
  
  In asyn-ares.c Curl_resolver_duphandle we can't use ares_dup anymore
  since it does not allow passing a different sock_state_cb_data

  Commit 5bfaa86ceb3c2a9ac474a928e748c4a86a703b33 introduced a new
  compiler warning on Windows cross compilation with GCC. See below
  for an example of the warning from the autobuild logs (whitespace
  edited to fit):
  
  /src/tool_cb_wrt.c:175:9: warning: cast from function call of type
      'intptr_t {aka long long int}' to non-matching type 'void *'
      [-Wbad-function-cast]
  (HANDLE) _get_osfhandle(fileno(outs->stream)),

  Store the return value from _get_osfhandle() in an intermediate
  variable and cast the variable in WriteConsoleW() rather than the
  function call directly to avoid a compiler warning.
  
  In passing, also add inspection of the MultiByteToWideChar() return
  value and return failure in case an error is reported.

  in libssh2_knownhost_init() is memory a allocation failure it's safest
  to avoid since the libssh2 error handling allocates memory.

  x509asn1: Fix SAN IP address verification
  
  For IP addresses in the subject alternative name field, the length
  of the IP address (and hence the number of bytes to perform a
  memcmp on) is incorrectly calculated to be zero. The code previously
  subtracted q from name.end. where in a successful case q = name.end
  and therefore addrlen equalled 0. The change modifies the code to
  subtract name.beg from name.end to calculate the length correctly.

  cmake: Backport to work with CMake 3.0 again
  
  Changes in commit 7867aaa9a0 (cmake: link curl to the OpenSSL targets
  instead of lib absolute paths, 2018-07-17) and commit f826b4ce98 (cmake:
  bumped minimum version to 3.4, 2018-07-19) required CMake 3.4 to fix
  issue #2746.  This broke support for users on older versions of CMake
  even if they just want to build curl and do not care whether transitive
  dependencies work.
  
  Backport the logic to work with CMake 3.0 again by implementing the
  fix only when the version of CMake is at least 3.4.

  Classic MinGW still has _beginthreadex's return type as unsigned long
  instead of uintptr_t [0]. uintptr_t is not even defined because of [1].

- vtls: fix ssl version "or later" behavior change for many backends
  
  - Treat CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_NONE the same as
    CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_DEFAULT. Prior to this change NONE would mean use
    the minimum version also as the maximum.
  
  This is a follow-up to 6015cef which changed the behavior of setting
  the SSL version so that the requested version would only be the minimum
  and not the maximum. It appears it was (mostly) implemented in OpenSSL
  but not other backends. In other words CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_0 used to
  mean use just TLS v1.0 and now it means use TLS v1.0 *or later*.
  
  - Fix CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_DEFAULT for OpenSSL.
  
  Prior to this change CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_DEFAULT with OpenSSL was
  erroneously treated as always TLS 1.3, and would cause an error if
  OpenSSL was built without TLS 1.3 support.

- urlapi: add CURLU_GUESS_SCHEME and fix hostname acceptance
  
  In order for this API to fully work for libcurl itself, it now offers a
  CURLU_GUESS_SCHEME flag that makes it "guess" scheme based on the host
  name prefix just like libcurl always did. If there's no known prefix, it
  will guess "http://".
  
  Separately, it relaxes the check of the host name so that IDN host names
  can be passed in as well.
  
  Both these changes are necessary for libcurl itself to use this API.
